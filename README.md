DRF seems to do so many things to spin up a project and features relatively fast... why is it not causing a problem in *our* system?

HyperlinkedRelatedField vs PrimaryKeyRelatedField, benefits? increased security? this reverse url thing is still a bit confusing to me?

lots of stuff is happening 'under the hood' in DRF, this is completely
different than what I am used to in vanilla JS and having to explicitly
write out everything that is happening.
